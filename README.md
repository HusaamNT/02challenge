# 02 Challenge 
## Challenges in the assignment
As a beginner, it was hard to understand what made HTML more or less accessible. After comparing the code given in the task to the code I had previously written, I found that the code was generally a lot more complex than what I had previously experienced but definitely not difficult. It wasn't as convoluted as it first appeared but the changes I applied made the code appear more visibly appealing aswell as more accessible. I searched for the syntax on each class to see what part of the code they affected and suitibly section them, aswell as comparing layouts of more accessible code to the assigned code. I then made changes accordingly after scrutinizing them.

## Changes made
To meet the acceptance criteria; 
*I separated each class so they were sectioned into their area. 
*Made the structure seem like they follow a logical structure and far easier to spot.
*Alt attributes were added to images for accessibility standards.
*The title was assigned appropriately.
*The structure is clearer and still in a logical order.
