# 02 Challenge 
## Challenges in the assignment
As a beginner, it was hard to understand what made HTML more or less accessible. After comparing the code given in the task to the code I had previously written, I found that the code was a lot more complex. It wasn't as convoluted as it once appeared but the changes I applied made the code appear more visibly appealing aswell as more accessible.

## Changes made
To meet the acceptance criteria, I separated each class so they were sectioned into their area. This made the structure seem like they follow a logical structure and far easier to spot.
Alt attributes were added to images for accessibility standards.
The title was assigned appropriately.
The structure is clearer and still in a logical order.
